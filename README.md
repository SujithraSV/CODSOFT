# CodSoft Internship - C++ Programming Tasks

This repository contains all the tasks I have completed as part of my **C++ programming internship** at CodSoft. Each task focuses on different problem-solving techniques and programming concepts, enhancing my knowledge and hands-on experience with C++.

## üìú **Tasks Overview**

1. **NUMBER GUESSING GAME**
  Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.
2. **Calculator Program**  
   A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.
 
   
3. **TIC-TAC-TOE GAME**  
  Build a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that
allows two players to play against each other

like resizing, cropping, and filtering.
## üöÄ **Skills Developed**
Throughout the completion of these tasks, I have developed and enhanced several skills, including:
- **C++ Programming**
- **Problem Solving and Logical Thinking**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Algorithm Development**

## üèÜ **Conclusion**
These tasks have not only improved my understanding of C++ but also strengthened my overall programming and analytical skills. I'm excited to continue applying these skills in real-world scenarios and expanding my knowledge in software development.
